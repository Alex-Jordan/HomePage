The New New Academy
===================

This is a big announcement that changes some things very little and some things a lot!

We have incorporated Runestone Academy and applied for 501(c)(3) status.  Creating the new corporation is done and official.  Eventually, Runestone Interactive LLC will cease to exist as a corporate entity.  As of January 1, 2022 the server that you have come to know as runestone.academy is operating under Runestone Academy LTD.

Why the change?
---------------

The reason for the change is really quite simple.  We want to keep Runestone free for all students.  Period, end of story.

However, the reality is a bit different. In an ideal world every school that used Runestone would send us $10 per student. This would allow us to hire support staff and incentivise new authors to add more books to runestone for very little cost to the school and no cost to the students.  But that does not happen.  I know that many school districts do not have big budgets, and my goal has never been to "get rich from Runestone." Don't even get me started about the legal fees we would have to pay to have the "contracts" from school districts reviewed!!!

**But** We have big goals!  I would love to see Runestone helping two million students a day instead of fifty thousand. To do that we need more authors, more books, more servers, more support people, and more programmers!  I am greatful to all of the schools and teachers that send us support! Although I feel bad about teachers that send me money from their own pocket! I am from and education family and I know how little teachers at public schools and small colleges make!

So, what to do?
---------------

The more I researched this problem the more convinced I became that Runestone had to become a non-proft.  This opens the door for us at many corporate and family foundations that care deeply about STEM education.  We have several grant applications outstanding, but like everything else, this is a process.  New groups have to prove themsevles, and that takes time.  In the meantime we will be rolling out new programs that make it possible for individuals or schools to help us financially.  More about that soon.
