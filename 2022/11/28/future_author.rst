An Open Letter to Future Authors

Dear Future Textbook Author Who Knows LaTeX,

LaTeX is a markup language which is designed to help you produce
nice PDF.  PreTeXt is a markup language which does everything
LaTeX can do, and in addition provides multiple output formats,
interactivity, and accessibility.  If you are writing a textbook,
you will find it well worth the effort to learn PreTeXt.  And it
is better to start with PreTeXt instead of writing in LaTeX and
then converting.

A major attraction of PreTeXt is that your book will be available
in multiple formats, including highly accessible HTML.  Formats are
only part of the story: if your book is merely the book you would
have written in LaTeX, translated into PreTeXt, the result will
fail to achieve its potential.  What will be missing are the
features of PreTeXt which support teaching and learning.

But first, what is a textbook?  In the past, the textbook was the
source of all material being taught in a course and also the source
of all examples, exercises, etc.  These days it is common for a
course to call on multiple resources.  PreTeXt makes it possible
to bring back the time when the textbook contained everything --
with PreTeXt the textbook can be the portal to everything needed
by the instructor and the student.

And second, what is *your vision* for *your
textbook*?  Some textbooks are a monograph: one person's
articulation of a particular subject -- a beautiful and
coherent exposition on a topic.  A monograph, even if it contains
many exercises, is no longer sufficient to be the sole resource for
teaching or learning a subject.  A modern textbook can be crafted
to enhance teaching and learning, supporting good pedagogy and
recognizing the realities that face both students and teachers.

If you are writing a monograph, some PreTeXt features will not be
of use to you.  But you will find that PreTeXt helps you think
about the structure of your document, resulting in better
exposition.  The extra features are available if you later decide
to use them.

If you are trying to actively support teaching and learning,
then PreTeXt has many features which will help you
create a textbook that improves learning and enhances teaching.

For example, some PreTeXt books have **preview activities**
at the start of each section.  A preview activity gives the student
a few tasks to perform -- tasks which they are capable of
doing with only their current knowledge and which introduce (without
using any terminology) the main concepts of that section.
This supports good pedagogy, because

  definition :raw-html:`&rarr;` example

works fine for research
and graduate level exposition, but in most of the undergraduate
curriculum

  examples :raw-html:`&rarr;` terminology

works better.

Other PreTeXt books have **reading questions** at the end of
each section.  An ideal reading question is easy for a student to
answer if they have understood the material in the section, and
difficult if they have not.  Reading questions are graded on effort.

Your book can be available in an online system (such as Runestone)
which gives the instructor easy access to the students' answers to
preview activities or reading questions.  A quick glance at those
answers immediately before class will allow the instructor to
productively modify their plans for the classroom, allowing more time
for those topics where the students need it most.

So:  think about how instructors might use your book.  Then create a
book which will help them be better instructors.

Let's think about the students.  What is the single most significant
cause, throughout the history of STEM education, for students
having difficulty learning the material?  A good case can be made for:
*the long delay between when they answer a question
and when they receive feedback on their answer*.  Some STEM fields,
notably physics and computer science, have recognized this issue and
taken effect steps to address it.  Numerous types of problems have
been created, where students can automatedly receive instant feedback
on their work.  Misconceptions and common errors are caught quickly,
and the result is better learning.

PreTeXt supports many types of interactive problems.  Multiple choice
and short answer, of course.  Also Parsons Problems (multi-step
answers where the steps are given, to be put in the correct order),
Matching (match Column A with Column B), Clickable Area, and more.
Not every type of problem is suitable for instant feedback, but
surprisingly many are.

PreTeXt also supports multiple types of interactive demonstrations,
such as GeoGebra, Desmos, Sage cells, CalcPlot3d, etc.  Students can
explore an example as much as they wish, and the demonstration can
be reset just by reloading the page.

So: think about how students might use your book.  Then craft a book
which will help them to learn more: more than they would just by
reading clear explanations, seeing illustrative examples, and
turning in their work to be graded later.

All of the interactive examples and exercises can be right there
in the book:  there is no need to cobble together and keep track
of a variety of resources.  If the book is hosted in Runestone,
the instructor has direct access to submitted student work and
a dashboard of learning analytics.

Some books have introductory videos in each section and some have
videos showing worked examples.  These are appreciated by those
students who prefer learning by watching and listening.  It is better
for your book to include quality material that you have selected,
instead of having your users wade through the swampy haystack of the
Internet.

It takes a while to start thinking holistically about how your book
will serve as the interface which connects the material you are
passionate about to the students learning the material and the
instructors helping the students to learn.  The ability to properly
support all of that activity, by yourself as an OER author,
is a new idea which is now made possible by the combination of PreTeXt
and Runestone.  But you are not by yourself:  there is an active
community of PreTeXt and Runestone users and developers, and there
is a growing list of textbooks which illustrate what is now
possible.

A good textbook might present the material in a clear and coherent
manner, but a *great textbook* actively supports teaching
and learning.

PreTeXt and Runestone are free and open source tools which can help
you craft a great textbook.
