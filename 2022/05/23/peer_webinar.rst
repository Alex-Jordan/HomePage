Peer+ Webinar
=============

Today, Barb Ericson and I hosted a webinar on Peer+.  Peer+ is an NSF funded research project on using Peer Instruction in a Runestone eBook.  Click the link to see a `recording of the 1 hour zoom <https://youtu.be/bP75MZYe2uU>`_ or feel free to just `look at the slides <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RsAAwYFxbpl_UiH7lDaLvdjRBcbLcLaqOTWb2M6QIjY/edit?usp=sharing>`_

I won't try to repeat the information here, but just emphasize that Peer Instruction is a well studied way to increase your students engagement and success in your class.  Please check it out, and don't hesitate to give us feedback on this exciting new feature.
