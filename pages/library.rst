Transforming Data with ClojureScript
------------------------------------

Written by J. David Eisenberg Designed for non-programmers, it
focuses on what is still one of the main programming tasks,
"transforming data." Based on ClojureScript it takes a
functional approach.

Computer Graphics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Learn WebGL
-----------

By Dr. C Wayne Brown of the US Air Force Academy. The
traditional approach to learning a subject is to divide the
topic into sub-topics, study each sub-topic, and then show how
the sub-topics relate to each other. That is not the approach
for these tutorials. These tutorials start with the “big
picture” and then study the details of each sub-system that
composes the complex overall system. The study of each
sub-system starts from basic principles and tries to avoid any
assumptions about what the student knows or does not know.

Course Reader - CS160
---------------------

Written by Andrew Scholer, "A collection I put together with
Runestone for my Intro to CS course. It is a creative commons
licensed set of materials I gathered from other open sources

Fundamentals of Web Programming
-------------------------------

Written by Brad Miller, this book is designed for a seven week
course I teach to majors and non majors. It introduces HTML,
CSS, and a bit of Javascript. `Fundamentals of Web
Programming <https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/webfundamentals/index.html>`__

Javascript for Python Programmers
---------------------------------

A work in progress, `Javascript for Python Programmers <https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/JS4Python/index.html>`_


Language Transition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Java For Python Programmers
---------------------------

This short book helps with the transition from Python to Java

`Java 4 Python <https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/java4python/index.html>`__

C++ for Python Programmers
--------------------------

Similar in spirit to Java 4 Python programmers, this book eases the transition from Python to C++.  Written by Jan Pearce at Berea College.

`C++ for Python Programmers <https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/cpp4python/index.html>`_



Everyday Python
---------------

An occasional blog, written by Brad Miller, that provides
contextualized programming lessons. Examples include Schooling
Fish, steganography, prime factors, and an XKCD style password
generator. Includes links to the "How to Think" book to cover
introductory material on programming constructs used in the
lessons. The idea is to focus on fun problems in lots of areas,
the goal is to turn this into a fun CS1 textbook.
