Support
=======

Hi Sorry you are having problems.  Runestone is an open source project, so people volunteer their time and energy to make it better. We don't have a full time support team, but we do our best to be helpful and responsive.

The best thing to do is to create an issue on our `GitHub <http://github.com/RunestoneInteractive>`_ page for the project that most closely matches your problem.

Here are a few other places you can try:
