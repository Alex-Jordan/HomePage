Support
=======

Hi Sorry you are having problems.  Runestone is an open source project, so people volunteer their time and energy to make it better. We don't have a full time support team, but we do our best to be helpful and responsive.

The best thing to do is to create an issue on our `GitHub <http://github.com/RunestoneInteractive>`_ page for the project that most closely matches your problem.

Here are a few other places you can try:

Join the conversation on **Discord**.  Unfortunately Slack has implemented new policies that limit our history to just 90 days.  That means all of the knowledge shared last spring dissappeard over the summer.  Discord has no such limits.  `Join us on Discord <https://discord.gg/f3Qmbk9P3U>`_


  I will be removing this link to slack in October 2022.  `The quickest way to get help from a human <https://join.slack.com/t/runestoneteam/shared_invite/enQtODUwNDIwMzg5NDQxLTZlMjAzOTNlNzNlYTVjZDEyODI4ZTY1YjFjNTg3YTBiOWY2ODNlZTA4NWFiMjAxNzlkZGE1MmY0ZTQyY2E5Y2Q>`_
