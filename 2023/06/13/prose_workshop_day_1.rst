PROSE Workshop Day 1
====================

Yesterday 30 of us convened at the University of South Alabama for the first day of the `PROSE <https://prose.runestone.academy>`_ workshop.  Steven kicked us off reminding us that the main goal for the week was to prepare for writing our Phase II proposal.  Rob and I both gave a little talk on the state of PreTeXt and Runestone.

In the afternoon we did an exercise to get everyone thinking about the different groups of stakeholders in the ecosystem and how we might serve them better.  We will hear more results from the that tomorrow.

In the evening, we convened a hackathon back at the hotel.  It was a noisy affair and we brought the hotel wifi to its knees.  We did manage to get a few things done though.
