Runestone Funding
=================

In 2018 I took advantage of an "early retirement" opportunity from Luther College to pursue working on Runestone full time.  That opportunity afforded me a year to figure out a business model for Runestone so that I could continue to give Runestone my full attention.  However, before the end of the 2017/2018 school year, I got an even cooler opportunity to work with a group Google working to bring computer science education to underserved institutions.  Google would use Runestone as the platform for the Applied Computing series and I would work with them, developing both content and features for Runestone.  This contract was originally written for five months, but ultimately extended to the maximum contract length of two years. Earlier this month the contract came to an end.

During this time period Runestone has experienced tremendous growth, pushed further this last spring as everyone had to move online.  Since the fall of 2018 over 116,000 students have registered on Runestone.academy!  That is a lot of students, and if you do the math, we have saved students around the world millions of dollars in textbook costs.  Just last week we hosted an online workshop for Runestone instructors with over 240 people registered!  If you missed it you can find the videos `on our YouTube channel <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnjfglXW2QQSVCuOj4VsdmWTRAfQy6Zrb>`_

While the last two years have been exciting, fun, and profitable, consulting for Google really isn't a business model for Runestone.  So, for the last many weeks I've been having conversations with some of the major stakeholders and contributors to Runestone including authors, and code hackers, and instructors like most of you. We have big hopes and dreams to grow the platform! Today I write to tell you the outcome of these discussions and how that will effect Runestone moving forward.

My goals for a funding model for Runestone include:

1. Keep Runestone books FREE for all students.  This has always been the North Star for me.

2. Provide a first class educational experience for all students using Runestone.

2. Make Runestone sustainable.  In other words, cover the server costs, pay myself a small salary, ideally provide for summer internship opportunities for a few students.

3. Provide a solid foundation to continue the growth and development of the Runestone platform. More authors, more books, better features.  For example

   1. Developing more user friendly tools to encourage new authors.

   2. Creating additional opportunities to customize textbooks.

   2. Funding for workshops for new instructors, hackers, and authors

   3. Continuing to develop innovative new features for Runestone books

   4. Develop communities of practice around each textbook where all instructors and authors can contribute ideas, teaching tips, assignments, teaching materials.

We considered many different models, and wow is it difficult to find a model that works for everyone given the wide range of people that use Runestone.  We serve everyone from independent learners to public high schools to large universities.  But starting soon, here are the three mechanisms we are going to try.


1.  All pages viewed by **non-registered** users will contain an advertisement.  Around 40-50% of the traffic on Runestone is realized as the result of a Google search. These users typically view one or two pages and then move on.  But the volume of this alone is quite large.  Let me be super clear When your students login and are viewing your course, they **WILL NOT** see an ad! This is to generate money from the large number of transient users of the Runestone pages. If your student sees an ad that should be a very clear indication that they are not logged in.

2.  Beginning this Fall, we will do a WikiMedia style fundraiser a few weeks into the term. By this I mean we will display banners to registered students that have not chosen to support Runestone. If your class is identified as a public high school course they will be automatically excluded from this as I realize it is not appropriate. Less than 1% of students choose to support Runestone at registration time.  However they haven't experienced a Runestone book yet.  Given a few weeks and the value that we provide I believe we can increase that percentage significantly by asking students a few weeks after they have used the books.  This ask will be limited in time so we will not nag them forever.  Just a week or so.

3.  I will continue to work with researchers at academic institutions to participate in grants.  Getting grant money to support the development of significant Runestone features is an awesome way to fund that development. I would welcome the opportunity to partner with any of you that are writing grants and using Runestone in your research or classes.

I think these are some of the least intrusive ways we can generate diverse revenue streams that will help us realize our goals. First and foremost I want to ensure that Runestone is robust and available for years to come. I welcome your feedback, thoughts and further ideas.

Thanks,

Brad
